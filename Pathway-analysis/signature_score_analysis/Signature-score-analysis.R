##### Read expression matrix and signature gene list.
##### Then, carry out data preprocessing
## 1) Data loading section.
# 1.1) gene expression matrix
expression<-read.table(expression_path,header = TRUE)
expression<-expression%>%dplyr::select(ENSEMBL=gene_id,everything())

# 1.2) To establish a general "embryonic pausing signature",
# First measured DE in each embryonic model independently
# Gene sigificantly dysregulated in both models were selected for the signature
# Other Gene signatures such as mTORC1 response were obtained from the MSigDB "Hallmark gene sets"
sign_gene<-read.xlsx(pathway_path,sheet = 1)
sign_gene<-sign_gene%>%dplyr::select(SYMBOL=Gene,everything())
# the expression value was multiplied by -1 if the gene was downregulated in the embryonic models,
# while the value of genes upregulated in the embryonic models was kept unchangedï¼Œ
### ==so that a positive expression value would always reflect a change similar to embryonic pausing.== 

# 1.3) create a sample imformation matrix
sample_info<-read.csv(sample_info_path,header=T,)

# 1.4) Read the matrix of effective gene lengths for calculating TPM
gene_efflen<-read.csv(gene_efflen_path)

## 2) Data processing section.
# 2.1) perform data processing on gene expression matrix.
gene_expression<-gene_matrix_preprocessing(expression,sign_gene,sample_info,gene_efflen)
# 2.2) calculation signature score.
sign_score<-signature_score(gene_expression,sample_info)
# save sign_score
write.csv(sign_score,paste0("Result/Signature_score_for_",pathway_name,"_using_",data_name,".csv"),row.names = F)
# 2.3) plot signature boxplot
plot1<-signature_score_plot(sign_score,title=plot_title,my_palette,comparisons=comparisons,ylab="Signature Score",Test_Methods="t.test",hide_ns=T,sign_label="p.signif")
# 2.4) save the figure.
